## TA Build Instructions:
We have posted the updated code in the Newsboard folder. Download the Newsboard.zip file. Now open Xcode and make sure that you have the latest XCode (XCode 8) installed This matters because Swift 3 needs to be installed. The second thing that needs to be installed is CocoaPods 1.0.0 in order for Firebase to work. 
    To install Cocoapods, go to your Terminal and type "sudo gem install cocoapods" At this step, the program should be ready to run. If there any questions, feel free to contact us and look at this link- https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup.

Update- Our subscription to TestFlight has expired. So, the following advice does not apply. 
All TA's will have received an email invitation to upload the latest draft of SportsFeed via TestFlight internal testing. Any updates will be built and pushed to TestFlight before the final deliverable is due.
